# How to Install and Run the Green Map
The Green Map is visualizer tool to see the state of large solar, wind, and geothermal power projects in the United States. It is built in React. To get the application to run locally, follow the instructions below.

## Getting Started
Unzip the compressed archive greenenergy.zip anywhere on your machine. Run 'npm install' to download all of the required node modules. One important callout, the npm package React Leaflet does not replace the vanilla JS version of leaflet. If npm complains that vanilla leaflet is not installed, you'll need to manually install it using the instructions on the [Leaflet website](https://leafletjs.com/SlavaUkraini/examples/quick-start/).

## Available Scripts

After completing the "Getting Started" section, navigate to the root folder of the application and use the standard Create React App scripts to run or build the Green Map. A portion of the Create React App readme is included below:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
